				 <p> Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with 398,300 residents. </p>
				 <p>Wellington is often referred to as New Zealand's cultural capital. It is home to the National Archives,
					 the National Art Gallery, the National Library, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, numerous theatres
					 and two universities. Wellington has many notable buildings including the Government Building - one of the largest
					 wooden buildings in the world - as well as the iconic Beehive. It also plays host to the annual World of Wearable Arts,
					 the Wellington Sevens, New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the Royal New Zealand Ballet. Wellington's cafe culture is
					 internationally recognised and the city is known for its large number of coffee shops and roasteries. It is also the
					 centre of New Zealand's film and special effects industries, and increasingly a hub for information technology and innovation.</p>
