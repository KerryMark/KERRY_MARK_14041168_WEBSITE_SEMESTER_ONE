			<h1>The Botanic Gardens</h1>
			<section>
				 <p> The Wellington Botanic Gardens is located on the side of the hill between Thorndon and Kelburn, near central Wellington. Created in 1868 and managed by the New Zealand Institute until the Wellington City Council began to manage it in 1891. Created with 25 hectares of land  for the protected native forest, conifers, plant collections and seasonal displays. The Botanic Gardens also features a variety of non-native species, including an extensive Rose Garden. It is classified as a Garden of National Significance by the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture. The Botanic Gardens is also a popular spot for Wellington residents and tourists. Mainly used for walking, jogging and taking children to the playground. </p>

				<p> Wellington's waterfront is best explored on foot, from Queens Wharf around the harbour through to the golden shores of Oriental Bay. The iconic Wellington cable car runs up to the botanic gardens and lookout - from there you can stroll back down to the city centre through native bush and greenery. Go down to the beach and swim in our blue waters or just relax on the beach and eat ice-cream while watching the sun set. </p>
